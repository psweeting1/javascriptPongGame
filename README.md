## What is it?

As a front-end challenge, we were asked to make a Javascript Game from a HTML Canvas. This is the game I created under 2 hours. Enjoy

## How to run it

- `npm install` - install node_modules
- `npm start` - run the local dev server
- `npm deploy` - build and deploy to a github pages branch

## How to play it
It's two players, one player can use keyboard keys A and D, the other Left Arrow and Right Arrow.
